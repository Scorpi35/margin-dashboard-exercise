## 2026-08-26 — MD-1: monorepo scaffold and tooling

Three npm workspaces (`shared`, `backend`, `frontend`) behind a single root
script set, so `npm install && npm run dev` serves both halves from a clean
clone.

Decisions worth knowing about:

- **Node is pinned to 22** (`.nvmrc`, `engines`). `better-sqlite3` 12.x ships no
  Node 20 prebuild, so Node 20 falls back to compiling from source and needs a
  working C++ toolchain. Node 22 downloads a prebuilt binary instead.
- **`shared/` is the workspace package `@shared/types`**, not a path alias. That
  gives backend and frontend the same import specifier while keeping the backend
  free of the `paths` entry the coding guidelines rule out.
- **`seed` and `selfcheck` are wired up but exit non-zero**, pending the parsers
  and the calculation engine. A self-check that always passes is worse than
  none, so the scripts fail loudly rather than reporting a green no-op.
- **`xlsx` is the npm-registry 0.18.5**, which carries an unfixed prototype
  pollution and ReDoS advisory. The maintained SheetJS releases are distributed
  only from `cdn.sheetjs.com`; switching the install source is still open.
- The backend targets CommonJS so `better-sqlite3` and the `tsc` build output
  need no ESM interop workarounds.
